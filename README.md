# YeboWork: Job Creation Project

##  Problem Statement
Youth unemployment in South Africa is critically high, especially among individuals aged 15–24. The lack of accessible job opportunities continues to contribute to poverty and social instability. Our team set out to explore this issue and propose data-driven solutions.

## Project Goal
To understand the unemployment landscape using publicly available data and visualize how job creation efforts can be better targeted — especially toward the youth.

## Data Summary
We used StatsSA's Q4 2024 unemployment data, focusing on three age groups:

| Age Group     | Unemployment Rate (%) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 15–24         | 59.6                   |
| 15–34         | 45.5                   |
| All Ages      | 31.9                   |

## Key Visualization

> “Unemployment among youth aged 15–24 is nearly double the national average.”
